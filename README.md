# IRIS_MODEL-NEURAL-NETWORK-
1.) This model is created using the iris dataset.<br>
2.) This model uses pytorch as the machine learning framework.</br>
3.) The model predicts the type of iris flower (Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor).</br>
4.) The model was prepared and created on the Google Collaborator.</br>
5.) The model was prepared using the two hidden neural network layers.<br>
6.) The model uses the nn.module class of the PyTorch for training and validation.
